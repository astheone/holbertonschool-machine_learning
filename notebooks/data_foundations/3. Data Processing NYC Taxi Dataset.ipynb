Hypotheses & Testing Methods**\n","\n","### **Hypothesis 1:**  \n","Short trips have higher fare-per-mile than long trips.  \n","**Testing:** compute `fare_per_mile`, compare distributions, run statistical tests.\n","\n","### **Hypothesis 2:**  \n","Taxi demand peaks during morning and evening rush hours.  \n","**Testing:** extract hour-of-day, plot rides per hour.\n","\n","### **Hypothesis 3:**  \n","Rainy days increase taxi usage.  \n","**Testing:** merge with weather data, compare ride counts on rainy vs dry days.\n","\n","### **Hypothesis 4:**  \n","Late-night trips have higher tip percentages.  \n","**Testing:** extract hour data, analyze tip rates by time category.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **5. Missing Data, Sparsity & Outliers**\n","\n","### **Missing values handling:**\n","- Remove rows with missing coordinates  \n","- Impute missing fare components with logical defaults  \n","- Validate payment and vendor IDs  \n","\n","### **Outlier removal:**\n","- Z-score or IQR filtering  \n","- Remove:\n","  - Distance > 50 miles  \n","  - Duration > 2 hours  \n","  - Negative values  \n","  - Unrealistic fare/amount combinations  \n","\n","### **Sparse data:**\n","- Rare pickup/dropoff zones will be grouped into broader borough-level categories.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **6. Dataset Splitting Strategy**\n","\n","### **If NOT time-series ML:**\n","- Train: **70%**  \n","- Validation: **15%**  \n","- Test: **15%**  \n","- Stratify if predicting categorical outcomes\n","\n","### **If time-series ML:**\n","- Train: 2019  \n","- Validation: Jan–Jun 2020  \n","- Test: Jul–Dec 2020  \n","- Ensures no future data leaks into the past\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **7.
